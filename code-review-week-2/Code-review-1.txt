Good things

Well defined tree structure, is nice, works well and easy to add to in future

Very comprehensive testing - pretty much everything has a test case

Support for reading/writing of variables is very good


Need improvement

Potential allowing input from files in the future

Tests could do with going into their own file of files to prevent exponential code growth in the future

Language could to with expanding as is currently very small
